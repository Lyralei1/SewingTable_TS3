# How do I contribute?
This Repository comes with all the DLL's and any necessities for it to work in Visual studio or SharpDevelop. This current project has been made in SharpDevelop so far, so it might mean that for Visual studio 2013 and up, you need to redo the settings: https://modthesims.info/wiki.php?title=Sims_3:Creating_a_game_compatible_Visual_Studio_project )

Any feature requests/Bugs can be found under 'Issues'. From those issues you may create a pull request in order to add/fix said issue/feature request. These, however are always checked. 

When working on a fix/addition, make sure to create a new branch called 'userName-Feature-issueName' or 'userName-bugfix-issueName'. Do NEVER commit directly to the master. This is just so that if something goes wrong, you can easily revert it back :) See: https://guides.github.com/ for any guidance.

Pull requests will always be checked by me :)
